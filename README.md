2. Add the following lines for both configuration:
    ```md

    ```

:information_source: One file is dedicated for dev purposes (like having a local server) and the other to production (like giving the real connection string for the bd)

### Commands

```commandline
python ./tools/update_students_list.py FILENAME.xlsx
```

To non registered migrate members :
This command enables you to migrate members to the new bot. It will register automatically members present on the discord.
```commandline
python ./tools/migrate_discord_students.py
```
It can happen that certain members cannot be migrated du to their name being too long or that we found duplicates.
If this happens, script will ask you if you want to contact them by hand or automatically by sending them a message asking them to register.
